 x link our files 
 - build the html of the site 


 - access the library api
    - we can hardcode the category first

    http://thedomain.com/this/is/the/path?foo=bar
    pr.cl    domain         path            query

    x postman http://openlibrary.org/subjects/love.json
    x dig out the cover, title, author
    x create the fetch
        x write a function that takes in a string and runs the api request 

 x function that returns the random book 
    x is ebooks_count the real count? if so use it 
    x works.length as the max in our random function 
    x Math.floor(Math.random() * works.length)
    x works[randomIndex]


 - present the info form the api on the dom 
    - book cover, author, title
    - build helper functions to generate the elements, and then append them
    -get the elements that are in the html that we'll append to    
 


 - wire up the input later
    -grab the input via a query selector and get its text
    -addEvenListener('click', input)
    -pass it into the search
